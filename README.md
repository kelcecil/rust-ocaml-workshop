# rust-ocaml-workshop
A companion repository for use with my Rust Belt Rust '16 workshop - Hey! There's OCaml in My Rust!

## Introduction

This repository contains code examples and solutions for my Rust Belt Rust '16 talk "Hey! There's OCaml in My Rust!"

## Arrangement

* ${src}/workshop - Source files for the workshop.
* ${src}/examples - Examples that may be of use during the workshop. Feel free to copy and paste as needed!
* ${src}/extras - Extra examples created during talk preparation not used in the talk but cool nonetheless.
